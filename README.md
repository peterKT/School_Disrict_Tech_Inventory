# inventory
The plan for this repository is to present the HTML/PHP pages used to fashion a simple inventory system for a school district's technology equipment. Inventory management involves different sorts of items (computers, printers, projectors), different attributes of those items (model numbers, item types, i.e. laserjet printer, inkjet printer, etc.), locations (buildings, rooms inside buildings), and other features. Of course, that means bringing in a backend database (or two) to hold all this information. 

So, while the Web pages to be included here create a site that works well and has proven very useful, it is immediately apparent that the code is completely meaningless in the absence of the MySQL databases that hold the information referenced or manipulated by the many PHP queries. 

Understanding that this type of project is very common, my goal is to find out how others communicate their database structures so a model for them can be presented along with the pages. That way potential users and contributors will be able to understand the utility of the queries and the tasks the pages perform.

On the other hand, possibly this sort of project is inapproriate for the GitHub environment.

So stay tuned while I find out.
